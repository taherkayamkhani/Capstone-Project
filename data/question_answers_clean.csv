""When I notice a decrease in employees meeting their quotas or even a lack of energy or enthusiasm about work, I typically like to initiate a fun reward system. For example, one time, I offered a $50 gift card to the restaurant of their choice for the employee with the highest sales numbers at the end of the week. I also hosted a work barbecue, which allowed coworkers to get to know one another better and their families. This often makes employees look forward to coming to work and working together."""

How do you feel about learning new ones?,"Representatives use a range of technologies to help them assist customers quickly and accurately. Specific programs used will vary from company to company, so a candidate who is comfortable with technology and learning new programs will be valuable.

Prior experience with call center technology

Experience working in high-volume call centers

An experienced employee in this industry will have memory devices and techniques to help them recall ever-changing information. What to look for in an answer: 
Habit of checking for changes in products
Sincere desire to improve retention

What to look for in an answer:
Desire to put the needs of others first when appropriate
Understanding the importance of safety first

Care Assistant,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/care-assistant?hl=en&co=IN,Why do you want to work as a care assistant?,"It takes a special kind of person to work as a care assistant: one who almost innately puts others’ needs before their own and does so with compassion. Often, a certain experience in someone’s past propels that person into care work. If a candidate has such a personal story inspiring them, it could drive the candidate to naturally excel at caring for others. Such a story may also prove that they are personally invested in their career.
What to look for in an answer:

Care Assistant,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/care-assistant?hl=en&co=IN,Why do you believe care assistants are important for people to have?,"Care assistants allow people in medical need to have an independence and comfort they might otherwise lack. People unable to care completely for themselves can live at home rather than a facility. Care assistants help people maintain as much of their normal and familiar lifestyles as possible. They must therefore also be strong and alert enough to attend to a client’s moment-to-moment needs or in case of an emergency.
What to look for in an answer:
Flexibility to spontaneous situations and needs
Willingness to encourage client independence as much as possible
Availability, alertness and physical fitness

You don’t want a care assistant to treat health care as a one-size-fits-all solution. Elderly clients, for example, may require physical assistance to safely attend to their daily needs, and they may also need to feel emotional companionship to keep their spirits uplifted. A candidate should be personable and patient with their clients’ needs.
What to look for in an answer:
Awareness of different clients’ different needs
Consciousness of elderly clients’ unique concerns
Sensitivity to emotional care in addition to physical
 
Example: 
“Physically, I’d help only with the specific needs assigned and, otherwise, only when specifically requested. Emotionally, I’d be an active listener all the time.”"
Care Assistant,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/care-assistant?hl=en&co=IN,How do you help a client maintain dignity while receiving personal care?,"Excellence as a care assistant requires empathy for the clients. Candidates should show that they are able to put themselves in the client’s shoes. The key to acting effectively from a place of empathy is to create an open line of communication. Open communication allows clients to take leadership of their own needs and, thereby, feel respected and as autonomous as possible.
What to look for in an answer:
Empathy for other people’s feelings
Strong listening and communication skills
Respect for a client’s autonomy, independence and personal dignity
 
Example: 
“Someone’s body may be failing them, but they’re still whole inside. I care for the whole person by compensating for the physical impediments.”"
Care Assistant,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/care-assistant?hl=en&co=IN,How do you approach confidentiality when you’re at and off work?,"Confidentiality is both an ethical and legal requirement for care assistants. A candidate’s awareness of the technical requirements for health care assistants regarding patient confidentiality shows you their level of experience in the role and commitment to performing it responsibly. A care assistant should never discuss a patient’s medical information with anyone unless specifically authorized in writing to do so.
What to look for in an answer:
Awareness of the legal confidentiality requirements of care assistants
A sense of personal and professional ethics
Experience in health care
 
Example: 
“I worked in hospital medical records, so I’m fully versed in HIPAA. Plus, I would never disclose any patients’ information unless they authorized it.”"

When looking for the best possible care assistant candidates, you want to find potential employees who understand and value the enormity of their role within your organization, so you can ensure they'll treat your clients or patients with the appropriate respect. 
Look for candidate answers that include these elements:
Respect and appreciation for the patients or clients 
Understanding of the role's value
Distinct descriptions of a care assistant's duties 
An excellent candidate response might resemble this example:
 
Example:

A good candidate will mention specific techniques such as positive redirection, diversion or distraction. What to look for in an answer:
Geriatric or special-needs training
Positive reinforcement techniques in handing special needs

Example: 
“I’ve learned how important compassion and acceptance is for Alzheimer’s patients. Using gentle redirection, I’ve seen how a well-organized day that’s flexible can help to reduce agitation.”"
Caregiver,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/caregiver?hl=en&co=IN,What is something your previous employer would say about your caregiving abilities?,"Although there is not a specific right answer, the candidate’s body language and facial features are important. The candidate’s response should focus on qualities they have such as reliability, compassion and professional preparation.

What to look for in an answer:
Positive attitude toward answering the question
Focuses on strong qualities including reliability and preparation
A spontaneous and unforced answer
 
Example:

In the candidate’s answer, the future caregiver’s focus should be on demonstrating positive reinforcement techniques that they can bring to your business. Some of these may include reassurance, routine and redirection. Undesirable answers would include a description of punitive or shame-based approaches to handling resistance.
What to look for in an answer:
Specific situations the candidate has experienced
A positive reinforcement approach and reassurance
Answers that suggest empathy and understanding
 
Example: 
“Showers can be scary for seniors. Instead of arguing, I focus on making it easy and fun. Using lots of warm towels also helps.”"
Caregiver,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/caregiver?hl=en&co=IN,Why do you want to work at this specific caregiving agency?,"Answers that reflect an understanding of your caregiving agency’s culture and clients are best here. Personal connections such as a relative or friend who was a caregiver or a client suggest in-depth knowledge of your specific business. The candidate should demonstrate knowledge of those qualities that distinguish your agency from the rest and be prepared to talk about being a good match for the job.
What to look for in an answer:
Knowledge of the caregiving agency’s mission
Fitness for the specific caregiving skills of the agency
An interesting anecdote that connects them to your agency
 
Example: 
“Your agency was a natural choice for me because one of your caregivers helped with my brother, and you specialize in treatment for autistic children.”"

What do you do?","A caregiver typically has one or more appointments to attend each day. This question allows interviewers to determine whether a caregiver offers additional time to patients to ensure their health and safety. It also allows interviews to gauge a candidate's ability to notify their agency about the situation to assign another caregiver to the upcoming appointment.
The candidate's answer should emphasize:
Good judgment
Communication abilities
Commitment to the patient
Here's an example of what a great answer could look like:
 
Example: 
""The first thing I would do is check their vitals based on their underlying health conditions. Then I would contact my supervisor to tell them what's happening and ask if anyone else could cover the next appointment. I would stay with the patient for however long necessary to ensure they're okay. If the situation called for it, I would either call an ambulance or take them to the doctor to be sure their condition isn't serious."""

A good answer might feature:
Attention to detail
Flexibility
Problem-solving
Here is one sample response:

An answer to this question could look like this:
""Customer service is an art. I feel that is must be practiced consistently in order to be mastered.

Creating customer loyalty helps to build a company and maintains a consistent standard of excellence. 
 
Example: 
""When working with clients it is important to listen closely to their concerns. I try hard to provide them with several different options to meet their needs so that they can feel a sense of ownership over their decision and understand that they have choices. If my first ideas are not to their liking, I ask some more probing and clarifying questions to better understand what they need. Overall, my goal is to be a source of information and support for them so they can trust me and the company. We want to keep their patronage."""

During the interview process, you will want to understand if your candidate practices from a psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, biological, cross-cultural, evolutionary or humanistic perspective.

What to look for in an answer:

Be sure that you understand the outcome of the case, the treatment time window and the correlation between treatment and results. If the candidate offers a routine case example, he or she may not have the experience needed to treat more complex psychological disorders.
What to look for in an answer:
Experience level with difficult or complex cases
Case conceptualization and approach
Level of focus on positive outcomes
 
Example: 
“One patient suffered years of childhood trauma. After an assessment and six months of therapy, the patient achieved an increased level of daily functioning.”"

For example, if your clinic treats many patients suffering from anxiety and depression, you’ll want someone with familiarity in those areas. However, if you see many elderly individuals who are struggling with mental health issues in combination with physical challenges, you may want to hire a psychologist with more experience with this age group.
What to look for in an answer:
Experience in areas where you have need
A broad understanding of common mental health issues
Specialty with particular age groups
 
Example: 
“I have spent most of my career treating adults between the ages of 25 and 50 with anxiety and depression disorders.”"

What to look for in an answer:
Experience in the setting you require
Understanding of individual, marital and group therapy
Willingness to grow into new areas

Their supportive role means that some clients may have trouble understanding appropriate professional boundaries. Top candidates understand that they need to set firm limits on how involved they can be in a client's life to make sure they're a safe, objective source of psychological support. 
A good answer should include:
An explanation of why boundaries are important in a mental health setting
Strategies for being professional with clients
Empathy and respect for their patients
One example answer that displays these qualities is:
 
 Example:  
""Many clients start therapy feeling isolated, and it's natural to feel friendly toward a psychologist when they listen to your issues and provide support. I make it clear that our interactions are limited to scheduled sessions, and provide them with the administrative business line as the source of contact. I limit the amount of information I divulge about my personal life to keep the session focused on the client. I also allow them to talk about their feelings about our professional relationship during sessions so we can work together to teach healthy boundaries that they can apply to their life."""

What to look for in an answer:
Realistic, relevant insight
Neutral language, not demeaning
An emphasis on prevention
 
Example: 
 “Some companies seem like they don’t focus enough on debt prevention. For example, maybe they need to develop better standards for approving loans or ask for a 50 percent down payment. As far as collection goes, it’s a good idea to stay in touch regularly with customers and to offer incentives for early payment. Give customers 5 percent off, and give them options for payment instead of restricting them to checks.”"
Collector,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/collector?hl=en&co=IN,"As a collector, you may have to negotiate with clients and set up payment plans to maximize the company's returns on bad debt. Tell me about a time you negotiated and compromised with a customer or client.","Because collectors aim to recover as much of their employer's financial liability as possible, they may find alternative methods to get back some or all of an outstanding balance from a customer.

A good answer may have these qualities:
Patience and understanding
Creative problem-solving
Focus on results
Here is one possible response:
 
Example: 
""At my last role, I often negotiated with clients about possible payment plans or incentives for paying off their balance.

Applicant’s understanding of how consultants can push companies forward
Overall interest in consultancy work
Industry experience or expertise
 
Example: 
 “Any company can benefit from working with an experienced consultant, not just because it can be cost-effective but also because they can help organizations spot issues and pinpoint inefficiencies they were perhaps missing. A talented outside perspective can offer solutions that improve overall performance and drive growth.”"
Consultant,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/consultant?hl=en&co=IN,How would you make our company more profitable?,"This question tests critical thinking skills and knowledge of your industry.

Example: 
 “I think the company has been incredibly successful within a highly competitive space. The future looks bright, but I think it can be even brighter if the business focuses entirely on the products and services that are delivering the most revenue and highest margins. By shedding products and services with low margins and revenues, you can become a more agile company and achieve greater profits.”"
Consultant,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/consultant?hl=en&co=IN,How do you adapt to a company’s culture when working on a project?,"Consultants are expected to take on temporary assignments that could last just a few weeks or go on for years.

What to look for in an answer:
Applicant’s method for adapting to new company cultures

Consultant,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/consultant?hl=en&co=IN,How should consultants set prices for projects?,"Since companies hire consultants from outside the organization, pricing always enters the discussion.

Applicant’s understanding of the consultancy industry and what drives pricing
Ability to calculate and track work expenses and profitably price a project

Example: 
 “Like anything, the market sets the price in consultancy. I believe rates shouldn’t be calculated according to hours worked. Instead, consultants should sell value.

Consultants also have a responsibility to clearly communicate their rates to the client, being sure to take into account the client’s budget. Negotiation should be carried out openly and honestly. There is some room for compromise on rates, but consultants must be careful to not go too low just to get the job.”"
Consultant,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/consultant?hl=en&co=IN,How do you size a market?,"In consultancy, market sizing is a vital skill. It’s how consultants calculate growth potential. The question is also a good way to see applicants’ thought processes and how they use various tools to reach an accurate number.

Look for answers that demonstrate quantitative and reasoning skills. What to look for in an answer:
Applicant’s critical thinking skills
Commitment to research and data-driven approaches
Ability to identify market opportunities
 
Example: 
 “Within a certain market, I examine population size and the percentage of people that use the product or service. By using surveys, analyzing data and identifying key issues customers are having with the industry, I can also estimate the number of customers we could serve but simply haven’t yet.”"

The features of a good response may include:
Strategic thinking
Ability to extrapolate based on data
Negotiation skills
 
Example: 
""I understand that company leaders have their own ideas about business development, informed by their professional experience. I find that seeking out common ground between our two work styles can help me convince others that there is merit to my suggestions. I'd acknowledge their concern, but use my data and research to show them the specific trends of past projects and how I would expect to apply them to their company. I always focus on the company's bottom line then backtrack to explain the specific cause-and-effect of my suggestions to provide an overall vision and specific justifications for my strategies."""

It was clear she wasn't going to make it to the hospital where she was scheduled to give birth, so we quickly prepped an exam room for her and got in touch with her doctor. We were able to keep her comfortable and calm until her doctor arrived to safely deliver the baby and transfer her to an appropriate location. 
At your facility, I think the most important thing for me to do will be to quickly build rapport and relationships with the nurses, doctors and support staff, so we can all count on one another when an emergency arises.

Keen observation skills
Ability to be empathetic to others’ emotions
A sense of patience and humility

I'd feel honored that the patient had a good enough impression of me to mistake me for a loved one. I'd interact with them in a friendly way without contradicting them while still maintaining a professional demeanor. I would record the interaction in their records so that other members of the care team were aware of how their condition was progressing."""

In contrast, the shortcrust pastry is typically used for quiches or tarts. Instead of proving the dough, you chill shortcrust pastry in the refrigerator before rolling it out. Puff pastry has a nice, light texture whereas shortcrust pastry has a more thick, biscuit light texture."""

What to look for in an answer:

Reference to specific KPIs and metrics
An example of a past product launch
Potential metrics for this company 
A good answer might reflect this example: 
 
Example: 
""Data is absolutely the best way to see if a launch was successful or not. The metrics I choose to use depend on the type of product and type of launch we're undertaking. For example, in the past I did a launch of a brand new product. I tracked the social engagement versus the actual number of purchases before and after the launch to see how effective our online strategies were. I would take a different approach if we were relaunching an existing product since the marketing campaign would differ substantially."""

What to look for in an answer:
Evidence they understand Python’s relationship to multithreading
Confirmation they have thought about the pros and cons
Indication they can work within your company’s policy
 
Example: 
 “I usually think multithreading creates more problems than it solves. Sure, it lets the system access more than one thread at a time, but at the cost of memory and CPU. It also makes the code more difficult to debug. I’ve also experienced deadlocks when I multithread, so I tend to avoid it.”"
Python,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/python?hl=en&co=IN,What would you say are the most common mistakes made using Python?,"Getting a look at both your candidate’s mastery of Python and big picture understanding of its pitfalls is important.

Here's an example of a good answer to this question:
 
Example: 
""Deep copy stores values that have already previously been copied. It also doesn't copy any reference pointers to certain objects. It'll reference an object, which leads the new object that's pointed by a different object to be stored as well. Since it makes copies for each object that's been called, deep copy slows down program execution. Shallow copies are different because they're used when a new instance type is created and keeps the copy values in a new instance. Since it doesn't make as many copies as deep copy, shallow copy's program execution is much faster."""

Ability to remain level-headed
Communication skills

""Earning a patient's trust is absolutely vital as a respiratory therapist.

Usually, I start by trying to learn as much as I can about the patients and finding a common interest we can discuss apart from their health. I make sure to ask about the things they like and value in our sessions to further develop our relationship. 
For example, I worked with a patient in the past who loved to knit. I asked that patient to teach me some basic knitting skills to help us develop a bond. She was more than willing to perform her treatments with me and on her own. We still keep in touch even though she's no longer my patient."""

Social Worker,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/social-worker?hl=en&co=IN,What kinds of clients do you find most difficult to work with and why?,"Being a social worker is stressful, and many social workers burn out quickly. Asking the above question lets you get an idea of how candidates handle stress and how compatible they might be with your organization. Look for:
Some positivity in the answer
No disparaging/blaming others or being overly negative
Accepting some responsibility in the situation
A good answer might be, “I find that the most difficult clients are those who have given up. That is, they’ve been failed by others and the system so many times that it feels like I can never reach them. They’re a good reminder to myself that I need to remain curious and to approach issues from multiple angles because all clients deserve my best.? 
Example: 
??"
Social Worker,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/social-worker?hl=en&co=IN,Why did you go into social work?,"People go into social work for different reasons, and asking about their motivations lets candidates talk about themselves and reveal background information that they might not be able to otherwise. Look for:
Going beyond a generic “desire to help others”
Specifics versus generalities
A commitment to social work
An effective candidate could answer, “My grandfather died of cancer when I was 10, and the hospice nurses and social workers paved the way for him to die at home and on his own terms. That experience opened my eyes to how I could help others advocate for themselves.? 
Example: 
??"
Social Worker,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/social-worker?hl=en&co=IN,What strategies do you use for crisis intervention?,"Conflict is inevitable in any field of social work, and this question allows you to check that candidates’ conflict-resolution skills fit what your organization is looking for.

Strategies that align with what your organization wants
Context they were practiced in
Lack of blaming others
A good answer might be, “When I worked at a women’s shelter, many of the residents would get upset when a routine changed. I started being more proactive by explaining up front and clearly what the plan for the day would be. When a crisis occurred, I used restatement, clarification and ‘I’ statements to ensure everyone was on the same page.? 
Example: 
??"
Social Worker,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/social-worker?hl=en&co=IN,What type of supervision do you prefer?,"Questions such as this one get to cultural fit. For example, if your agency needs social workers who take instruction well, then someone who prefers to work alone independently and to be given a lot of leeway might not be the best fit. Look for:
Candidate compatibility
Ability to acknowledge weaknesses
Reasoning behind preference
An example of a good answer could be, “I’ve been a social worker for 20 years, so it’s critical that my supervisors trust my judgment. I need to know they have my back. However, I do realize that even the most-seasoned professionals make mistakes or can do things better, so I seek out feedback when I’m conflicted. I always enjoy going to workshops and continuing-education seminars.? 
Example: 
??"
Social Worker,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/social-worker?hl=en&co=IN,What are the signs of abuse?,"This question assesses candidates’ competence for the job, and one of the most important things they should know has to do with recognizing the signs of abuse in whatever population you work with, be it at-risk youths, children in public schools, the elderly or another segment. Look for:
Ability to answer quickly
Specifics
Factual answers (not answers like, “These poor, pitiful people…”)

It is also another opportunity to ensure that candidates fit your organization’s missions and values. Look for:
Flexibility instead of rigidity
Orientation toward teamwork
Ability to recognize flaws in self
A good candidate could reply, “I had a hospice patient who was in tremendous pain yet he simply would not go on pain medications because he saw them as a sign of weakness. He became belligerent when nurses tried to force the medications on him, and I realized that I needed to be more flexible. My insistence that he take the medications meant that he was no longer in control of his life and his choices, and that was wrong.?

Social Worker,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/social-worker?hl=en&co=IN,What is the most important aspect about managing clients’ feelings?,"A big duty of social workers is to keep situations as conflict-free as possible so that there can be resolution.

Social Worker,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/social-worker?hl=en&co=IN,What would you do if a client acted aggressively or negatively toward a suggestion you made?,"Social workers are expected to react logically and rationally to high-pressure, emergency situations. One that commonly occurs is when a client has a negative reaction toward a piece of advice the social worker recommended, which can sometimes result in aggression.

The candidate's answer should emphasize:
Strategy for handling difficult or aggressive clients 
Ability to stay calm in high-pressure situations
Decision-making skills 
An answer to this question could look like this:
 
Example: 
""My first reaction to clients who act negatively or aggressively toward me during a session is to remain calm. I'll use my listening skills to let them tell me why they're upset, confused or angry. I'll then summarize their thoughts and ask any clarifying questions to show them that I'm working to gain clarity on the situation. Afterward, I'll explain my goal of trying to work together with them to come to a solution that benefits all parties. If the situation escalates and they remain hostile or aggressive, I'll implement the organization's safety protocol to ensure everyone nearby remains protected."""
Software Architect,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/software-architect?hl=en&co=IN,"Which programming languages are you proficient in and certified with, and what are your experiences with using them?","Experts often agree that you should aim for the best fit for an architecture position long-term rather than the best software architect who knows the particular programming language you need.

What to look for in an answer:
Modern programming language diversity
Languages pertinent to the position at your company
The drive to seek certifications and other such recognitions
 
Example: 
“I graduated knowing C++, C#, HTML, PHP, Oracle and SQL Server. Since then, I have learned Python and Ruby and achieved MCSD and other certifications.”"
Software Architect,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/software-architect?hl=en&co=IN,"What is the most complex project you have worked on, and was it difficult for good or bad reasons?","The fundamentals of software architecture only prepare a software architect to navigate unexpected challenges, which will undoubtedly be faced with each new project. The goal here is to learn how the candidate deals with the hardest challenges that they face. Find out what they learned from them, and how they can carry forward to subsequent projects that will be an asset for your company.
What to look for in an answer:
Positive disposition toward challenges
Honest account of working on hard projects and learning something from the challenge
Realization of any patterns and anti-patterns
 
Example: 
“My most challenging project was an equipment leasing backend. It was exciting because it demanded learning about inventory, financials, CRM-type functions and so on. Although it was hard at first, I came away from it with new, valuable skills that I continue to use.”"
Software Architect,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/software-architect?hl=en&co=IN,What has been your proudest moment as a software architect thus far?,"This question is less about right and wrong answers and more about gaining insight into how a candidate thinks and feels within the context of their field. Seemingly generic answers are not necessarily bad, such as a data architect whose proudest moments come from the day-to-day effort to ensure a clear data model that other architects can use with little to no explanation.
What to look for in an answer:
Tangible excitement and pride
Real insight into what was achieved

An appreciation for Robert C. Martin’s five principles of OO design demonstrates an understanding beyond high-level concepts, which most students tend to possess. It shows that a software architect appreciates what it means to be object-oriented at a granular level. It is more important that a candidate understands the five concepts rather than specific terms.
What to look for in an answer:
Awareness of who Robert C. Martin is
Understanding of the five core concepts
Appreciation for the fundamentals of object-oriented design
 
Example: 
“SOLID stands for single-responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation and dependency inversion principles. These are the first five rules of OO design by Martin.”"
Software Architect,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/software-architect?hl=en&co=IN,What is dependency injection and in which scenarios would you opt to use it?,"This question builds on the last regarding SOLID design. Understanding dependency injection demonstrates that a software architect not only understands SOLID but knows how to achieve it in a real-world scenario. Dependency injection does this by decoupling creation from usage and is important to modern coding because it reduces the frequency at which classes need to be updated just because their dependencies changed.
What to look for in an answer:
Knowledge of what dependency injection is
Understanding of when you may want to use it
Insight into particular use cases
 
Example: 
“Dependency injection is the decoupling of object usage and creation. It is a technique that makes it easier to adhere to the SOLID principles.”"

Previous professional experience
Multiple interpersonal skills
Here is one example of a quality candidate answer:
 
Example: 
""I believe I have a few key interpersonal skills that contribute to my role as a software architect, including interpersonal communication, detail orientation and time management.

This is especially helpful when I need to explain the necessary time-frame for a project. I also need to have a keen attention to detail to catch coding errors and time management ensures I meet my deadlines."""
Software Developer,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/software-developer?hl=en&co=IN,You're stumped by a coding problem. What resources do you use when you need to research a solution?,"Software development is a complex process that requires excellent research skills.

He treated us like mature and intelligent individuals and was able to impart his passion for the subject matter into the curriculum. He provided a framework for the students to lead discussions and critical analysis of abstract philosophical and existential questions that really engaged all of us.

“I would like to work at Santa Margarita because of the excellent reputation it has for academics, athletics, and quality of education. Students are challenged to push themselves and the abundance of AP and IB classes show that the school gives them the opportunity to succeed. It is also well known that the parents are active in their children’s education and I believe that is one of the most critical aspects of a successful education. It is also well known that the teachers here are passionate about what they teach and it shows with performance and test scores.”"

Everyone has a different teaching style and students react differently to different styles.
 
Example: 
“I think that students look for passion and credibility and can easily see when one or both are present or absent. Teachers have different styles, but the passion and drive of a teacher is essential. Teaching is a difficult job, but it is also one of the most important. Students need to know that you are working hard, expect them to do the same, and will grade them fairly while guiding them through the critical thinking process.”"
Teacher,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/teacher?hl=en&co=IN,What personality traits do teachers need to be successful?,"This question evaluates a candidate’s ability to asses the role and determine what is required for success. This will allow the candidate to assess their own requirements as well as those required by the administration.
 
Example: 
“I think that teachers need to have patience, flexibility, and self-discipline to be successful. Teaching can be difficult and frustrating, but it is extremely rewarding and it takes a certain type of individual to excel. Teachers have to consider state/local testing objectives when creating lesson plans while making sure that students are able to master the subject material beyond what is going to be on a test. Students also have different methods of learning and a teacher must be able to adapt their lessons to ensure that all students are engaged and able to learn the material.”"
Teacher,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/teacher?hl=en&co=IN,How do you approach discipline and what role does it play in learning?,"Teachers routinely deal with discipline issues in the course of their daily activities. It is extremely important for a candidate to explain how they view discipline and what role it plays in the classroom. Discipline is an important part of maintaining an effective learning environment and largely depends on teaching style, age of students, and district policies.
 
Example: 
“I believe that discipline is an important part of the learning process. I approach it by clearly explaining what is expected and what the limits are in my syllabus as well as my initial class orientation. Discipline is the foundation of respect in the classroom and accountability from the students. In my experience, students do not respond well to forceful discipline. They want a framework where they agree to the rules, are respected as individuals, and are held accountable for their decisions and actions.”"
Teacher,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/teacher?hl=en&co=IN,How do you interact with parents?,"This question is designed to assess how the candidate interacts with parents. Parents are an important part of the learning process and teachers must have the ability to communicate with them in a positive way to help the students be successful.
 
Example: 
“Parents play a critical role in supporting their child’s education. I feel that it is extremely important to engage them and ensure that a student is set up for success. I provide contact information for parents and encourage them to contact me if they have any questions about their child’s performance or progress. I believe in sending home periodic updates about what they children are learning and what is being accomplished in the classroom. This way, parents are able to ask their children how things are going and discuss the current curriculum and major tests and projects. I approach parental communication in a way that puts us all on the same team with the same goal, which is ensuring the success of the student.”"
Teacher,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/teacher?hl=en&co=IN,"How have state, local, or common core standards affected your lesson planning process?","Standards and standardized testing is an important part of teaching. This question assesses the candidate’s understanding of what is expected of them, how they plan their curriculum, and whether or not they will just “teach the test”.
 
Example: 
“Standards are clearly an important focal point for the curriculum. I believe that thorough curriculum planning and assessments are the best way to structure the year and ensure that students cover the required material. The way that I approach this is to start with the framework of standards and build my lessons around them. I do not teach only what will be assessed in testing, but I make sure that it is included. Objective performance is an excellent way to gauge students’ understanding of the material and my curriculum map allows me to ensure that the necessary skills are covered and assessed prior to standardized testing.”"
Teacher,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/teacher?hl=en&co=IN,What do you think of technology in the classroom and how have you integrated it into your lessons?,"Technology has become commonplace as a teaching tool in many classrooms. This question assesses how the candidate utilizes available technology to help students learn as well as teaching them basic technological skills.
 
Example: 
“I believe that technology in the classroom can be a valuable asset that helps students learn. I also think it has the potential to be a distraction and requires the teacher to have an established plan for acceptable use. It is important that students learn how to use technology for education as well as teaching them basic technological literacy and I have incorporated it into my lessons by assigning students tasks that require more advanced use of technology. For example, all of my papers must be in MLA format. I teach the format and the students must learn to adjust margins, spacing, line breaks, citations, and other more advanced features of word processors throughout the year. Not only do they become experts at the formatting, they also learn how to manipulate formatting through repetition and exploration of these features that they would otherwise not have been exposed to. This exposure allows the students to get comfortable with the platform and creates a foundation that helps them use technology both inside and outside of the classroom.”"
Teacher,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/teacher?hl=en&co=IN,What do you do when you notice one or more students struggling with course material?,"This question helps interviewers determine whether teacher candidates have the ability to identify struggling students and help them succeed. This is an important question to ask candidates because not every student has the same learning style and some have learning disabilities that prevent them from grasping a concept or school subject in the same way as other students.

Compassion for their students and their progress
Willingness to devote additional time to students
Specific example highlighting their actions for helping students
Here's an example of what a good answer might look like:

This question can show you how applicants view leadership and implement their style.
What to look for in an answer:
Applicant’s leadership capability and style
Commitment to developing team members
Ability to provide constructive criticism
 
Example: 
 “I do not employ a top-down leadership style because I believe a leader should act like a supportive coach. I give my team members space to unleash their talent while providing constructive feedback, regular performance reviews and training sessions. I aim to run an open, transparent and honest operation. My goal is to know employees well so I can help them grow and improve. This is how the team wins.”"
Team Leader,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/team-leader?hl=en&co=IN,What metrics do you use to evaluate team performance?,"Team leaders are not just expected to generate and share detailed performance reports with the team and company management.

What to look for in an answer:
Applicant’s method for improving team performance
Knowledge of performance metrics

Example: 
“Given all the data we have today, it’s essential that team leaders analyze and extract insights from that data to increase effectiveness. My opinion is that the metrics a team focuses on should strongly link to a company’s strategic objectives. In a general sense, I always look at quantity, quality and time. For instance, to measure the quality of work, it’s important to look at the number of errors and customer satisfaction. Another thing I measure is employee morale and engagement because those can make or break a team.”"
Team Leader,https://www.indeed.com/hire/interview-questions/team-leader?hl=en&co=IN,How do you interview prospective team members?,"Many companies ask team leaders to participate in the interview process for applicants to their team.

I've found in my past experience that most employees do best when you get out of the way and give them the space they need to do their work independently. I'm always present, however, and implement regular check-ins, both formal and informal, to ensure my team has all the support and resources they need. 
Knowing a bit about your company culture, I think this approach will work well. The innovative and creativity driven culture fits well with my leadership style."""
